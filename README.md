# bird_specie_prediction
### This is a project that constist of a web app using streamlit for prediction Birds specie.
Although the functionality of the project is limited due to the inability to access a good data for this project but i can alway do better if 
data are available.

### Approach and the model
In this project, we will create a convolutional Neural network which will be able to predict species of birds. We will use different layers and hyperparameters for building, training, and testing this multiclass classification problem. we will be using keras and tensorflow in this project.

## Aim and Objective of this project:
Motivation for project
Birds, known to play an important role in pollination, putting a check on pesky insects and rodents, could also be causing drastic decrease in crop yields by destroying them, according to a report, which calls it as an emerging concern in Indian agriculture(This also happens through out the world).

The avian species inflict losses in agriculture by damaging crops during sowing, seedling and ripening stages, leading to economic losses to the farming community, shows the interministerial report of the Committee on Doubling Farmer’s Income (DFI) - Volume X titled "Risk Management in Agriculture", released by the Ministry of Agriculture.

“Birds are known to cause considerable economic damage to variety of crops during vulnerable stages in different agro-ecological regions of the country. The extent of bird damage to any crop depends on several factors like concentration of local bird population, total area under the crop, cropping pattern habitat of the area, season and physiological status of the birds,” stated the report.

It identified 63 bird species of birds, 1,364, from 19 families that caused damage to several crops. A whopping 52 bird species attacked cereals, pulses got attacked by 14 bird species, while oilseeds faced damage risk by 15 species, and fruits by 23 species. They also caused damage to the crops of smaller grains such as pearl millet and sorghum as well as maize.

Of these, the Grey Partridge, Blue Rock Pigeon and House Sparrow were found to inflict most damage to crops. Other species include the Rose ringed parakeet, weavers, munias and doves that manage to nest in close proximity to agricultural fields.

The report, however, also identified 46 bird species as beneficial for agriculture. They help destroy insects feasting on crops and also consume rodents. Such beneficial birds need to be encouraged and conserved, the report suggested.

Moreover, bird damage was found to be more in isolated, early or late maturing fields, varied between regions, seasons, number of species, their density, concentration of migrants and their food habits.

Protecting the production system and effective management of vertebrate pests is important to realise targeted yields.

While traditional management techniques for predatory birds include erecting a machan amidst crop fields, pitcher-effigy (scare crows), drum beating; habitat manipulation, block plantation, reflective ribbon for bird scaring, reflective paper plate, bird resistant hybrids, could be some of the eco-friendly management methods.

State departments should help in the dissemination of such technologies to farmers for protecting the standing crop from raids and damages, the report suggested.

importance of project
This project will help to classify different bird species that could cause harm to farm produce or that could be beneficial to farm produce

although this is a mini project based on the fact that we have limited birds data..

### Step to solve the problem:
* importing the image on our notebook.
* extracting the images in jupyter notebook.
* visualizing the image that we will be working on.
* converting the image into a numpyarray and normalizing them
* checking class imbalance
* splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding.
* creating modl architecture, compliling the model and then fitting it.
* plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch
* preprocessing the test data and making prediction on it.
* visualizing the original and predictd labels for the test images.
